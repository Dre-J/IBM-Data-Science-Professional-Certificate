# RStudio & Github
> R is a statistical programming language and is a powerful tool for data processing and manipulation. Starts with an introduction to R and RStudio. Learn about the different R visualization packages and how to create visual charts using the plot function. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) have become critical tools in software development and key enablers for social and collaborative coding. While there are many distributed versioning systems, Git is amongst the most popular ones. Develop the essential conceptual and hands-on skills to work with Git and GitHub. Start with an overview of Git and GitHub, followed by creation of a GitHub account and a project repository, adding files to it, and committing changes using the web interface. Become familiar with Git workflows involving branches and pull requests (PRs) and merges. Complete a project at the end to apply and demonstrate newly acquired skills.
