# Model Development
> Learn how to define the explanatory variable and the response variable and understand the differences between the simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models. Learn how to evaluate a model using visualization and learn about polynomial regression and pipelines. Learn how to interpret and use the R-squared and the mean square error measures to perform in-sample evaluations to numerically evaluate the model. And lastly, learn about prediction and decision making when determining if the model is correct.
