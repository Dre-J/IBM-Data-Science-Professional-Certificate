# Model Evaluation and Refinement
> Learn about the importance of model evaluation and discuss different data model refinement techniques. Learn about model selection and how to identify overfitting and underfitting in a predictive model. Learn about using Ridge Regression to regularize and reduce standard errors to prevent overfitting a regression model and how to use the Grid Search method to tune the hyperparameters of an estimator.
