# Exploratory Data Analysis
> Learn what is meant by exploratory data analysis, and learn how to perform computations on the data to calculate basic descriptive statistical information, such as mean, median, mode, and quartile values, and use that information to better understand the distribution of the data. Learn about putting data into groups to help visualize the data better, learn how to use the Pearson correlation method to compare two continuous numerical variables, and learn how to use the Chi-square test to find the association between two categorical variables and how to interpret them.
