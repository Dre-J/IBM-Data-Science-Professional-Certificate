# Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data
> Advanced visualization tools are sophisticated platforms that provide a wide range of advanced features and capabilities. These tools provide an extensive set of options that help create visually appealing and interactive visualizations. In this module, learn about waffle charts and word cloud including their application. Explore Seaborn, a new visualization library in Python, and learn how to create regression plots using it. In addition, learn about folium, a data visualization library that visualizes geospatial data. Furthermore, explore the process of creating maps using Folium and superimposing them with markers to make them interesting. Finally, learn how to create a Choropleth map using Folium.
